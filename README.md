# Bodhi-Tree
 a basic business site for a NY-based mental health counselor


Designed and built from the ground up, Bodhi Tree continues under development today as Julie's practice continues to grow. 

Unique challenges have included: 
- initial UI, which has been subsequently optimized 
- making elements responsive on a variety of devices, and learning how to test for compatibility
- expanding the site as the business has grown, adding new elements and streamlining the existing ones to make for a cohesive design
- client relations, going back and forth via messages and email and scheduling the ocassional phone call to clarify what she needs the website to do and where the prorities lie.
